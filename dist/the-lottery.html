Readers' initial negative response surprised both Jackson and <cite>The New Yorker</cite>: subscriptions were cancelled, and much hate mail was received throughout the summer of its first publication, while the Union of South Africa banned the story.

In a small village of about 300 residents, the locals are in an excited yet nervous mood on June 27. Children gather stones, as the adult townsfolk assemble for their annual event, which in the local tradition is apparently practiced to ensure a good harvest (Old Man Warner quotes an old proverb: <q>Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon</q>). However, some other villages have already discontinued the lottery, and rumors are spreading that a village farther north is considering doing likewise. The lottery preparations start the night before, with coal merchant Mr. Summers and postmaster Mr. Graves drawing up a list of all the extended families in town and preparing a set of paper slips, one per family; all are blank, except for one later revealed to be marked with a black dot. The slips are folded and placed in a black wooden box, which in turn is stored in a safe at Mr. Summers' office until the lottery is scheduled to begin. Over the years, the box has become battered and discolored and has been stored in various places around town when not in use. On the morning of the lottery, the townspeople gather shortly before 10 a.m. in order to have everything done in time for lunch. First, the heads of the extended families each draw one slip from the box, but wait to unfold them until all the slips have been drawn. Bill Hutchinson gets the marked slip, meaning that his family has been chosen. His wife Tessie protests that Mr. Summers rushed him through the drawing, but the other townspeople dismiss her complaint. Since the Hutchinson family consists of only one household, a second drawing to choose one household within the family is skipped. For the final drawing, one slip is placed in the box for each member of the household – Bill, Tessie, and their three children. Each of the five draws a slip, and Tessie gets the marked one. The townspeople begin to stone her to death, as she screams about the unfairness of the lottery, and the slips blow away in the wind. </p> <h3>Reception and legacy</h3> <p> One of the major ideas of <cite>The Lottery</cite> is that of a scapegoat. The act of stoning someone to death yearly purges the town of the bad and allows for the good. This is hinted in the references to agriculture. The story also speaks of mob psychology and the idea that people can abandon reason and act cruelly if they are part of a large group of people behaving in the same manner. The idyllic setting of the story also demonstrates that violence and evil can take place anywhere and in any context. This also shows how people can turn on each other so easily. When or where it is set specifically, is never said, leaving some to consider it science fiction. Alongside the mob mentality, the story speaks about people who blindly follow traditions without thinking of the consequences of those traditions. </p> <p> <cite>The New Yorker</cite> received a "torrent of letters" inquiring about the story, <q>the most mail the magazine had ever received in response to a work of fiction</q>. Many readers demanded an explanation of the situation in the story, and a month after the initial publication, Jackson responded in the San Francisco Chronicle (<time datetime="1948-07-22">July 22, 1948</time>): </p> <blockquote> <p> Explaining just what I had hoped the story to say is very difficult. I suppose, I hoped, by setting a particularly brutal ancient rite in the present and in my own village to shock the story's readers with a graphic dramatization of the pointless violence and general inhumanity in their own lives. </p> </blockquote> <p> <cite>The New Yorker</cite> kept no records of the phone calls, but letters addressed to Jackson were forwarded to her. That summer she regularly took home 10 to 12 forwarded letters each day. She also received weekly packages from <cite>The New Yorker</cite> containing letters and questions addressed to the magazine or editor Harold Ross, plus carbon copies of the magazine's responses mailed to letter writers. </p> <blockquote> <p> Curiously, there are three main themes which dominate the letters of that first summer—three themes which might be identified as bewilderment, speculation and plain old-fashioned abuse. In the years since then, during which the story has been anthologized, dramatized, televised, and even—in one completely mystifying transformation—made into a ballet, the tenor of letters I receive has changed. I am addressed more politely, as a rule, and the letters largely confine themselves to questions like what does this story mean? The general tone of the early letters, however, was a kind of wide-eyed, shocked innocence. People at first were not so much concerned with what the story meant; what they wanted to know was where these lotteries were held, and whether they could go there and watch — Shirley Jackson, <cite>Come along with me</cite>. </p> </blockquote> <h3>Adaptations</h3> <p> Ellen M. Violett wrote the first television adaptation, seen on Albert McCleery's <cite>Cameo Theatre</cite>. Larry Yust's short film <cite>The Lottery</cite> (<time datetime="1969">1969</time>), produced as part of Encyclopædia Britannica's <cite>Short Story Showcase</cite> series, was ranked by the Academic Film Archive as <q>one of the two bestselling educational films ever</q>. It has an accompanying ten-minute commentary film Discussion of <cite>The Lottery</cite> by University of Southern California English professor James Durbin. Featuring Ed Begley Jr. as Jack Watson in his third film, Yust's adaptation has an atmosphere of naturalism and small-town authenticity with its shots of pickup trucks in Fellows, California, and the townspeople of Fellows and Taft, California. Anthony Spinner's feature-length TV film <cite>The Lottery</cite>, which premiered <time datetime="1996-09-29">September 29, 1996</time>, on NBC, is a sequel loosely based on the original Shirley Jackson story. It was nominated for a <time datetime="1997">1997</time> Saturn Award for Best Single Genre Television Presentation. </p> </section> </div> <footer> <p> © Text and images from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Jackson">Wikipedia</a></p> <img src="/logo.fcd53e55.png" class="mini-logo"> <p>Web design by Juan Luis Blanco</p> <p>Herramientas HTML y CSS UOC 2020</p> <img class="clip-me" src="/Jackson_shirley-clip.029e062f.jpg" alt="Shirley Jackson's close up"> </footer> </main> </body></html>

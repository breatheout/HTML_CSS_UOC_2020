A finalist for the National Book Award and considered one of the best literary ghost stories published during the 20th century, it has been made into two feature films and a play, and is the basis of a Netflix series. Jackson's novel relies on terror rather than horror to elicit emotion in the reader, using complex relationships between the mysterious events in the house and the characters’ psyches. </p> </section> <section class="section-home2"> <img class="bookpage-img" src="/HauntingOfHillHouse.8fc1daf9.jpg" alt="Book cover image"> <h3>Sinopsis</h3> <p> Alone in the world, Eleanor is delighted to take up Dr Montague's invitation to spend a summer in the mysterious Hill House. Joining them are Theodora, an artistic 'sensitive', and Luke, heir to the house. But what begins as a light-hearted experiment is swiftly proven to be a trip into their darkest nightmares, and an investigation that one of their number may not survive. </p> <h3>Reception and legacy</h3> <p> In a New York Times review in <time datetime="1959">1959</time>, Edmund Fuller wrote, <q>With her 'conceit' of Hill House, whether pretty be the name for it or not, Shirley Jackson proves again that she is the finest master currently practicing in the genre of the cryptic, haunted tale.</q> Stephen King, in his book <cite>Danse Macabre (<time datetime="1981">1981</time>)</cite>, a non-fiction review of the horror genre, lists <cite>The Haunting of Hill House</cite> as one of the finest horror novels of the late 20th century and provides a lengthy review. According to <cite>The Wall Street Journal</cite>, the book is <q>now widely regarded as the greatest haunted-house story ever written</q>. In his review column for <cite>The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</cite>, Damon Knight selected the novel as one of the 10 best genre books of <time datetime="1959">1959</time>, declaring it <q>in a class by itself</q>. Reappraising the book in <cite>The Guardian</cite> in <time datetime="2010">2010</time>, Sophie Missing wrote, <q>Jackson treats her material – which could be reduced to penny dreadful stuff in less deft hands – with great skill and subtlety. […] The horror inherent in the novel does not lie in Hill House (monstrous though it is) or the events that take place within it, but in the unexplored recesses of its characters' – and its readers' – minds. This is perhaps why it remains the definitive haunted house story</q>. In <time datetime="2018">2018</time>, <cite>The New York Times</cite> polled 13 writers to choose the scariest book of fiction they have ever read, and Carmen Maria Machado and Neil Gaiman both chose <cite>The Haunting of Hill House</cite>. Carmen Maria Machado wrote in <cite>The Atlantic</cite> about her experience discovering <cite>The Haunting of Hill House</cite>. She was at a writer's retreat while working on her short story <cite>The Resident</cite>, and was told her story reminded readers of Shirley Jackson. Having read little of Jackson, Machado decided to read Hill House: <q>When I went back home to Philly, I picked up a copy. And I just devoured it. I read it in one sitting. I started reading one night, and when my girlfriend (now wife) went to bed I just kept reading. It scared the shit out of me. Even though the events that appear to be supernatural activity are few and far between, those scenes are so chillingly written—as if Jackson was describing a phenomenon she’d seen before and really understood. The book’s particular brand of surreality felt, to me, like that experience of walking home from a party a little bit drunk, when the world somehow seems sharper and clearer and weirder.</q> </p> <h3>Adaptations</h3> <p> The novel has been adapted to film twice, in <time datetime="1963">1963</time> and again in <time datetime="1999">1999</time>, both times under the title The Haunting. The <time datetime="1963">1963</time> version is a relatively faithful adaptation and received critical praise. The 1999 version, considerably different from the novel and widely panned by critics, is an overt fantasy horror in which all the main characters are terrorized and two are killed by explicitly supernatural deaths. It was also parodied in <cite>Scary Movie 2 (<time datetime="2001">2001</time>)</cite>. The plot of The Legend of Hell House and the book on which it is based, Hell House both written by Richard Matheson, have several details in common with Jackson’s novel (and the <time datetime="1963">1963</time> movie adaptation The Haunting) in which a party of four (some psychic, some skeptical, some British, some Americans) stay in an extremely haunted Gothic mansion house with a terrible history, for the purposes of scientific study, and all are plagued by unseen terrors. A loose television adaptation was released in <time datetime="2018">2018</time> to critical acclaim. It changed many elements from the novel, keeping mainly its Hill House setting, Mr and Mrs Dudley, and a few character names, but shifted the focus to members of a singular haunted "Crain family." It was directed by Mike Flanagan and was produced for Netflix. </p> </section> </div> <footer> <p>© Text and images from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haunting_of_Hill_House">Wikipedia</a></p> <p>Web design by Juan Luis Blanco de los Santos</p> <p>Herramientas HTML y CSS UOC 2020</p> </footer> </main> </body></html>

        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p><i>Shirley Hardie Jackson</i> (<time datetime="1916-12-14">December 14, 1916</time> – <time datetime="1965-08-08">August 8, 1965</time>) was an American writer, 
          known primarily for her works of horror and mystery. Over the duration of her writing career, which spanned over two decades, she composed six novels, two memoirs, 
          and more than 200 short stories.
        </p>
        <p>Born in San Francisco, California, Jackson later attended Syracuse University in New York, where she became involved with the university's literary magazine and 
          met her future husband <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Edgar_Hyman">Stanley Edgar Hyman</a>. After they graduated, the couple moved to New York and began 
          contributing to <cite>The New Yorker</cite>—Jackson as a fiction writer and Hyman as a contributor to <cite>Talk of the Town</cite>. The couple settled in North Bennington, 
          Vermont, in <time datetime="1945">1945</time>, after the birth of their first child, when Hyman joined the faculty of Bennington College.</p>
        <p>After publishing her debut novel <cite>The Road Through the Wall</cite> (<time datetime="1948">1948</time>), a semi-autobiographical account of her childhood in California, 
          Jackson gained significant public attention for her short story "<cite>The Lottery</cite>", which details a sinister underside to a bucolic American village. She continued to 
          publish numerous short stories in literary journals and magazines throughout the fifties, some of which were assembled and reissued in her <time datetime="1953">1953</time> 
          memoir <cite>Life Among the Savages</cite>. In <time datetime="1959">1959</time>, she published <cite>The Haunting of Hill House</cite>, a supernatural horror novel widely 
          considered to be one of the best ghost stories ever written.</p>
        <p><q>The persona that Jackson presented to the world was powerful, witty, even imposing,</q> wrote Zoë Heller in <cite>The New Yorker</cite>. <q>She could be sharp and aggressive 
          with fey Bennington girls and salesclerks and people who interrupted her writing. Her letters are filled with tartly funny observations. Describing the bewildered response of 
          <cite>The New Yorker</cite> readers to <cite>The Lottery</cite>,</q> she notes, <q>The number of people who expected Mrs. Hutchinson to win a Bendix washing machine at the 
          end would amaze you.</q>
        </p>
        <p>In an era when women were not encouraged to work outside the home, Jackson became the chief breadwinner, while also raising the couple's four children. 
          By the 1960s, Jackson's health began to deteriorate significantly as a result of her increasing weight and cigarette smoking, ultimately leading to her death due to a heart 
          condition in 1965 at the age of 48. Jackson has been cited as an influence on a diverse set of authors, including Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, Sarah Waters, Nigel Kneale,

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>In <time datetime="2007">2007</time>, the <b>Shirley Jackson Awards</b> were established with permission of Jackson's estate. They are in recognition of her legacy in writing, 
        and are awarded for outstanding achievement in the literature of psychological suspense, horror, and the dark fantastic.
        </p>
        <p>In <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, Susan Scarf Merrell published a well-received thriller, <cite>Shirley: A Novel</cite>, about Jackson, her husband, a fictional couple who 
          move in with them, and a missing girl. In <time datetime="2020">2020</time>, the novel was adapted into a feature film, <cite>Shirley</cite>, directed by Josephine Decker. 
          Elisabeth Moss portrays Jackson and Michael Stuhlbarg costars as Stanley Edgar Hyman.
        </p>
        <p>In <time datetime="2016">2016</time>, journalist Ruth Franklin published <cite>Shirley Jackson: A Rather Haunted Life</cite>, a biography examining the influence of Jackson's 
          upbringing, marriage, and addictions upon her work, while positioning Jackson as a major figure in American literature and examiner of postwar American anxieties via "domestic 
          horror." Franklin's biography would go on to receive the National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography, the Edgar Award for Critical/Biographical Work, and the Bram Stoker 
          Award for Best Non-Fiction.
        </p>
        <p>Since at least <time datetime="2015">2015</time>, Jackson's adopted home of North Bennington has honored her legacy by celebrating Shirley Jackson Day on June 27, the day the
          fictional story <cite>The Lottery</cite> took place.
